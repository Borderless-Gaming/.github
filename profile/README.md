## 📌 Overview  

**Borderless Gaming** is a widely-used software that converts traditional fullscreen or windowed games into **borderless windowed mode**.

- Smooth transitions between applications.  
- Games running in a stable, non-minimizing window.  
- Better compatibility for streamers and content creators.  

The software supports almost every PC game and is especially popular in titles like **Minecraft**, **Metro Exodus**, and many more. By simplifying the process of creating a **borderless window**, it ensures gamers focus on their gameplay without distractions.  

Its open-source nature and free availability make Borderless Gaming a trusted choice for both casual players and professionals. Whether you’re a streamer, a competitive gamer, or someone who just wants to alt-tab freely, this software provides a reliable solution.
